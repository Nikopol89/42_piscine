SED, stream editor
the sed expression s/~/ /g replaces every tilde with a space character. It means, literally, "substitute everything that matches the regular expression ~ with a space, globally (on the whole input line)". The expression could in this case also have been written as the quicker y/~/ /, and the whole sed command could be replaced by the even faster tr '~' ' '.
